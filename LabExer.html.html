    <h2>Dark Fantasy</h2>

    <hr>

    <p>Dark fantasy is a sub-genre of fantasy that ventures into darker, more disturbing, and more frightening themes. It’s similar to horror, but for the fact that horror tends to be set in our own world, whereas dark fantasy takes place in an imagined
        one, often with a medieval or high fantasy setting.</p>
    <p>Horror stories set in our own world tend to feel more real, more visceral, and thus more terrifying. We can easily imagine ourselves being hunted by a serial killer in a small town. But that link to the real world can constrain the story, making it
        feel less imaginative, less evocative.</p>
